# Portfolio Projects

### Hey!

#### This repository includes some of the projects, I have worked on for enhancing my knowledge in-terms of using different statistical techniques and also in software and programming language learning such as of Python, and R. 

#### The projects have helped me improve my data analytical thinking and how business decisions can be made. Furthermore, I have also tried to focus on the Data-Science Aspect by working on supervised learning algorithms and a bit of NLP.
