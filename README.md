## Introduction üöÄ

In this repository, I've compiled my data analysis projects that demonstrate my skills in extracting insights, creating visualizations, and drawing conclusions from datasets. Each project comes with a detailed explanation, showcasing the problem statement, methodologies, findings, and visual representations.

## Projects üóíÔ∏è

### Project 1: 
- **Description**: Analysing climate data of Melbourne and Sydney using Statistical Techniques
- Tools/ Languages Used: R Programming (R-Studio)
- Abstract: The study analyzed Maximum Temperature and Solar Exposure in Melbourne and Sydney, discovering deviations from normal distribution in both cities. Despite similarities in central tendencies, the observed ranges didn't align with expected norms, signaling the need for deeper statistical inquiry in climate data analysis.

### Project 2: 
- **Description**: Data driven analysis of Global Life Expectancy Data
- Tools/ Languages Used: R Programming (R-Studio)
- Abstract: The study compared life expectancy between men and women, finding that despite data not following typical patterns, women tend to live notably longer. However, data gaps from some regions limit generalizations, and historical trends suggest varying outcomes across different time periods regarding life expectancy disparities between genders.

### Project 3:
- **Description**: Predicting Who Would Subscribe for a Term Deposit at the Bank
- Tools/ Languages Used: Python Programming (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Abstract: The study aimed to identify key features and predict term deposit subscriptions. Despite slightly lower cross-validation scores, the Decision Tree Model showed strong performance in estimating subscription likelihood, especially crucial in banking for revenue maximization. Ultimately, the Decision Tree Model stood out as the preferred tool for forecasting term deposit subscriptions, aligning with banking needs for revenue-driven predictions.

### Project 4: 
- **Description**: Analysing and Predicting Gasoline Prices using Time Series Analysis
- Tools/ Languages Used: R Programming (R-Studio)
- Abstract: The analysis of Average Gasoline Prices from 2013 to 2023 revealed consistent levels below $3 per gallon, except for a significant rise post-pandemic. Differencing was favored as it yielded satisfactory outcomes with minimal data loss. Based on the model, the forecast predicts gasoline prices between $3.6 to $4.0 per gallon in the next 10 months from the dataset's last recorded month.

### Project 5: 
- **Description**: Understanding Regression Techniques via Implementation on International Tourism Data
- Tools/ Languages Used: R Programming (R-Studio)
- Abstract: The dataset was split for model testing, focusing on unseen data. Initially, all regression variables pointed to 'Tourism Expenditure' as highly significant, explaining 98.77% variance and meeting assumptions. Refinement via Backward Elimination sustained significance in variables, but Model 3 with only 'Tourism Expenditure' showed less overfitting yet failed linearity and variance assumptions. Model comparison favored Model 2, displaying better adaptability to new data with a lower PRESS statistic, leading to its deployment after thorough evaluation.
